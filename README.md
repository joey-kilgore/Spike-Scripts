# Spike Scripts  
This is a collection of spike scripts written by various people, but then compiled and put here for anyone to continue collaborating.  
Please see the issues page for submitting ideas for new scripts.  
Each file should have extensive documentation on its purpose and how to use it, but if you still have questions goto the issues page and there is a question template you can choose when submiting a new issue.
